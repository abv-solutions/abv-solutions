# About Me

I have 4 years of experience working in the engineering and technology fields. I’ve helped companies like De’Longhi and Continental solve various problems by creating tools that help with product workflow automation, process optimization, management and traceability.

My expertise lies in the development of web-based and desktop applications that provide solutions at both the product development and production level.

I am an overachiever focused on constant improvement. Whatever the problem, I always find the most innovative solutions. I see every task as a new challenge and take pride in my ability to deliver the best results with passion and complete dedication.
