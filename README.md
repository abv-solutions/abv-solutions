# About Me

With over 10 years in software engineering and technology leadership, I’ve helped organizations such as GEP, De’Longhi, and Continental transform operations through web-based solutions that streamline processes, boost efficiency, and automate workflows.

I specialize in designing and delivering end-to-end web applications and cloud-native platforms, combining modern technologies with agile practices to solve complex business challenges. As a Technical Lead, I’ve guided diverse teams to build business-critical applications, empowering them to operate autonomously and deliver high-impact results at speed.

As a Professional Scrum Master™, cloud-certified engineer, and Top-Rated Freelancer on Upwork, I bring both structure and adaptability to every engagement. I take pride in creating tailored solutions that exceed expectations—balancing hands-on engineering with strategic leadership.

I work fluently across JavaScript (Angular, React), C#, ASP.NET Core, Node.js, Express, SQL, MongoDB, Firebase, HTML, and CSS—always eager to explore new tools that push innovation forward.
